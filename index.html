                    <p>It is important to train your body to go long distances, but you<br>
                    don't want to overtrain and risk injury.  Most ultra-runners recommend<br>
                    running 4-6 times per week.  One of these runs should be a long run <br>
                    (eventually building up to 30 miles).  The rest should be moderate distance<br>
                    runs (anywhere from 5-10 miles).
                    <br>

                    <p>If you're training for an ultra-marathon, you're going to want<br>
                    to eat a well balanced diet.  Your diet should include whole grains,<br>
                    lean proteins, healthy fats, &amp; (obviously) fruits and vegetables.</p>

                    <p>An ultra-marathon is considered any race that is longer than a marathon.<br>
                    It could be a 30 mile race, or it could be north of 100 miles!</p>
